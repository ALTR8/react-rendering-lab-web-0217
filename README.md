# React Rendering

## Objectives

1. Explain what happens when React renders a component
2. Explain why `render()` must be idempotent
3. Describe the parts of the component lifecycle leading up to and coming after
   `render()`
4. Practice using different parts of the render/update portion of the React
   component lifecycle.

## Overview

We want to give students practice experience hooking into each part of the
updating phase of the React component lifecycle.

`componentWillReceiveProps()`
`shouldComponentUpdate()`
`componentWillUpdate()`
`render()` (kind of)
`componentDidUpdate()`
